Everyone's stationery has been mixed up, and we need help sorting it out!

## Objective

Your goal is to return each person's school items. Listen to Bob, the cat sitting opposite you, and he'll tell you who each item belongs to.

## Controls

Simply tap and hold the item in the middle of the screen, then drag it to the correct cat.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Listening

Bob will say phrases like:

| **It's my pen** | Give the pen to Bob, the red cat |
| **It's your pen** | Take the pen for yourself, the purple cat |
| **It's his pen** | Give the pen to Tom, the blue cat |
| **It's her pen** | Give the pen to Ali, the pink cat |

Listen carefully to decide who should receive each item.

### Moving the Object

Move the object to the correct cat by dragging it up, right, left, or down the screen.

## Progression

As you advance, Bob will change how he speaks:

| **1** | It's [pronoun] [object] |
| **2** | It's [pronoun] |
| **3** | [pronoun] |

For example:
"It's her pen" -> "It's hers" -> "hers"

## Gameplay Loop

You'll need to return multiple items at each stage to complete the game.

## Victory

To win, you must correctly identify all the items and give them to their rightful owners.
