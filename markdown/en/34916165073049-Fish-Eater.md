Welcome to the ***Fish Eater*** game! In this ocean-themed adventure, you'll need to be bigger and faster than the other fish to survive. Let's learn how to play!


## **Goal**

**The open water is full of danger. Your mission is to ***become the biggest, fastest fish*** in the ocean by eating smaller fish. That way, no other fish will be able to threaten you!**


## **How to Play**

To swim around, simply ***tap anywhere on the screen*** with your finger. Your fish will swim to that spot. Remember, you can't eat just any fish – some are ***bigger and faster*** than you.


## **Eating Fish**

Don't worry – our friendly ***narrator*** is here to help!

Listen carefully to the narrator, who will tell you which fish you can safely eat.

For example, if the narrator says you can eat ***shrimp***, ***tap the screen*** to swim toward the nearest shrimp.

Great catch! Keep going – your fish is hungry! Try to eat all the ***shrimp*** you can find.

But be careful where you swim – bigger fish are looking for their next meal too!


## **Avoiding Bigger Fish**

Oops! Stay away from those big ones. We're not ***big enough*** to eat them yet.


## **Growing Bigger**

Now the tables have turned! Watch those smaller fish try to escape!

After eating enough small fish, you can start hunting bigger ones.

Watch out though – those ***crabs*** are now after you, just like the bigger fish were before.


## **Game Progress**

Next step: grow big enough to eat those crabs. You know what to do – eat anything smaller than you.

Just remember: there's always a bigger fish. No matter how large you get, watch out for bigger, faster fish.


## **How to Win**

Eat fish to grow bigger and fill up the ***progress bar*** level by level.

To win, simply fill the progress bar completely.
