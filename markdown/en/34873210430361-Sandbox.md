Welcome to Sandbox, an innovative game designed to help your child learn a new language while having fun. Let your child dive into the sandbox, uncover hidden words and phrases, and expand their vocabulary in an engaging and interactive way.

## Game Objective

The goal of Sandbox is simple: uncover all the hidden words in the sandbox. Players swipe away the sand to reveal language treasures underneath. The more they explore, the more new words they discover and learn!

## Controls

Playing Sandbox is easy. Your child simply uses their finger to swipe across the sandbox on the screen. This swiping action simulates digging and reveals hidden words and phrases.

## How to Play

### Digging for Words

Players dig for words by looking for shadows beneath the sand. These shadows hint at hidden words and phrases waiting to be discovered.

### Uncovering Words

When a word or phrase is completely cleared of sand, the game presents it in both your native language and the target language. This helps reinforce learning through direct association.

### Finding Special Items

While digging, players might discover special items that create additional learning opportunities. For example, finding a rubber duck teaches the word "duck" in the target language.
