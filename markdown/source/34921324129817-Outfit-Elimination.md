You may be asking yourself, who are all these strangely dressed dudes? Well, let me introduce you to the ***Outfit Elimination*** game! In this tutorial, we will be learning how to play. Let’s get started!


 


## **Objective**


We have one simple goal: ***find the right person.*** How are we going to do that? By using their terrible taste in fashion against them! We’re going to use the color of their clothes to narrow down our options. If the color doesn’t match the piece of clothing, we eliminate that person!


 


## **Clothing buttons**

What’s the deal with these buttons? When you tap one, you will hear a statement about the person we’re looking for.


This statement comes in two different forms:


 




| He/she | is not wearing | a | \[color] | \[clothing] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| He/she | is wearing | a | \[color] | \[clothing] |


 


*Example 1:* **She is wearing a red t\-shirt.**



*Example 2:* ***He is not wearing a green hat.***

The button will turn yellow after you’ve tapped it, so you know which ones you’ve tapped already. You can tap a button at any time to listen again.

So what about our green hat guy? What do we do with him? Well, I’ve got some bad news for you.


 


## **Elimination**


Swipe him upwards, and POOF! He’s gone. He committed the crime of wearing a green hat, and now he has disappeared.


After seeing that, I bet you’d like to try, too. It’s pretty easy. All you have to do is ***place your finger on a person and swipe upwards***. Then, you’ll be poofing people in no time. Eliminate everybody who is wearing a green hat!


 




| **Rank 1** | You can make as many mistakes as you like. |
| --- | --- |
| **Rank 2** | Three levels. More people. You will lose if you make too many mistakes. |
| **Rank 3** | Three levels. You will lose if you make too many mistakes, AND you must finish the game before the clock runs out. |

## **Let’s play!**


Now that you know what you’re doing, why not tap more of those buttons and eliminate some more people? We have to narrow them down to a single person, after all.


Have fun!
