If you purchased your free trial or subscription from within your Studycat app on an iOS device, your account is managed through your Apple ID.



Apple do not share your personal or purchase details with Studycat. Furthermore, Apple will only accept account instructions from the account holder, which means that we are unable to request this on your behalf. Please see the instructions below about how to cancel your subscription.



## How to cancel a subscription on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch

2\. Tap your name and then tap Subscriptions.

If you don’t see ‘Cancel Free Trial’ or ‘Cancel Subscription’, the subscription is already canceled and won't renew.
