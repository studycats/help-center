If you're experiencing issues with hearing anything in the Studycat app, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Your Volume:**
   
   * Ensure that your device’s volume is turned up. Use the volume buttons on your phone or tablet to increase the sound level.
2. **Turn Off Silent Mode:**
   
   * Make sure your device is not on silent mode. Switch off the silent mode using the toggle button on the side of your phone or via the settings menu.
3. **Enable Background Music:**
   
   * Open the Studycat app and go to the settings menu.
   * Ensure that the background music is turned on.
4. **Check Other Apps:**
   
   * Verify if the sound issue is specific to the Studycat app by playing audio in other apps (e.g., YouTube, music player).
   * If other apps also have no sound, the issue might be with your device rather than the Studycat app.
5. **Restart Your Device:**
   
   * Sometimes, a simple restart can fix sound issues. Turn off your device completely and then turn it back on.

If you've tried all these steps and still can’t hear anything, please [contact our support team](https://help.studycat.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) for further assistance.
