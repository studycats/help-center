Letter Maze is a fun game where you learn letters by moving through a maze. Listen for the letter at the start, then find all matching letters in the maze. Here's how to play!

## Goal

Find all the matching letters that you hear at the start of the game. Move through the maze to collect each letter and complete the level.

## Controls

Simply tap the screen where you want to go. Your character will follow your taps through the maze.

### Starting

When you begin, you'll see a maze and hear a letter. Your task is to find every instance of that letter in the maze.

You'll encounter other letters in the maze that aren't your target letter. Try to avoid these while searching for the correct one.

## Moving Forward

Each time you complete a maze, you'll move to a new one with a different letter to find. The mazes become more challenging as you progress, helping you learn more letters.

## Game Flow

Each round follows the same pattern: start the game, navigate the maze, find the letters, and avoid incorrect ones. This continues as you play through each level.

## Difficulty

Letter Maze starts simple and gradually becomes more challenging. Higher levels feature more complex mazes that test both your navigation skills and letter recognition.
