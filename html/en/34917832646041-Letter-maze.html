<p>You'll encounter other letters in the maze that aren't your target letter. Try to avoid these while searching for the correct one.</p>
<h2>Moving Forward</h2>
<p>Each time you complete a maze, you'll move to a new one with a different letter to find. The mazes become more challenging as you progress, helping you learn more letters.</p>
<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<p>Each round follows the same pattern: start the game, navigate the maze, find the letters, and avoid incorrect ones. This continues as you play through each level.</p>
<h2>Difficulty</h2>
<p>Letter Maze starts simple and gradually becomes more challenging. Higher levels feature more complex mazes that test both your navigation skills and letter recognition.</p>
