<p>Studycat Adventure is now organized into short, topic-based lessons using <em>spaced repetition</em> to help reinforce learning over time. Each topic includes 3–6 lessons, with each lesson consisting of 3–6 games. These topics are spaced throughout the learning path to ensure your child retains what they've learned.  </p>

<p><strong>Studycat Lessons</strong></p>
<p>Studycat lessons are carefully curated \&amp; scaffolded to optimize language acquisition. Each lesson consists of 3-6 interactive games focusing on vocabulary, grammar, literacy, speaking \&amp; building confidence. These shorter bite-sized lessons help your child stay focused and motivated.   </p>
<p>We recommend doing 3-4 of these lessons in each session.   </p>
<p><strong>Lessons are divided into:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong>/review games</li>
<li><strong>Practice</strong> games</li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong> games</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong> checkpoints</li>
</ul>
