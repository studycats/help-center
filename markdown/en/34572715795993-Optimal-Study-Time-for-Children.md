Determining the right amount of time for your child to spend on language learning can be crucial for their development and interest in the new language. With Learn English by Studycat, a balanced approach is key to making the learning process effective and enjoyable.


**Recommended Study Time:**


- **Frequency**: Aim for 3-5 sessions per week. Consistent exposure helps reinforce new vocabulary and concepts without overwhelming your child.


- **Duration**: Each session should last about 15 minutes. This length is ideal for maintaining your child's attention and ensuring they stay engaged without becoming fatigued.


**Flexibility and Progression:**


While starting with 15-minute sessions, it's important to remain flexible and adapt to your child's growing interest and capabilities. As your child becomes more comfortable and engaged with the language, you can gradually increase the duration of their sessions.


The key is to monitor your child's enthusiasm and responses. If they show keen interest, extending learning time can be beneficial. Conversely, if they seem tired, it's perfectly fine to stick with shorter sessions.


By beginning with short, frequent sessions and adjusting as needed, parents can ensure that language learning with Learn English by Studycat remains a fun, effective, and stress-free experience.
