<p>If you're experiencing issues with hearing anything in the Studycat app, try the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Your Volume:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that your device’s volume is turned up. Use the volume buttons on your phone or tablet to increase the sound level.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn Off Silent Mode:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure your device is not on silent mode. Switch off the silent mode using the toggle button on the side of your phone or via the settings menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable Background Music:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Studycat app and go to the settings menu.</p>
</li>
<li>Ensure that the background music is turned on.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Other Apps:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify if the sound issue is specific to the Studycat app by playing audio in other apps (e.g., YouTube, music player).</p>
</li>
<li>If other apps also have no sound, the issue might be with your device rather than the Studycat app.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restart Your Device:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, a simple restart can fix sound issues. Turn off your device completely and then turn it back on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
