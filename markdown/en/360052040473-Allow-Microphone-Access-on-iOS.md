## Why does Learn English need microphone access?

Learn English needs your device's microphone for speaking activities and pronunciation practice. This helps improve your child's speaking skills and pronunciation.

## How to enable microphone access

If you previously denied microphone access, you'll need to:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Microphone**
2. Find **Learn English** in the list of apps
3. Toggle the switch next to Learn English to **ON**

## Still having issues?

If you continue to experience problems with microphone access:

* Make sure you have the latest version of Learn English installed
* Try restarting your device
* If the problem persists, please contact our support team

**Note:** Microphone access is required for many learning activities. Without it, some speaking and pronunciation features will not work properly.
