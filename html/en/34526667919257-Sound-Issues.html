<p>If you're having trouble hearing sound in the Studycat app, try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Your Volume:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your device's volume is turned up. Use the volume buttons on your device to adjust the sound level.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn Off Silent Mode:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that your device isn't in silent mode. Switch off silent mode using the toggle switch on the side of your device or through the settings menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable Background Music:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the Studycat app and go to the settings menu.</p>
</li>
<li>Verify that background music is turned on.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check Other Apps:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test if the sound issue is specific to the Studycat app by playing audio in other apps (like YouTube or your music player).</p>
</li>
<li>If there's no sound in other apps, the problem might be with your device rather than the Studycat app.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Restart Your Device:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A simple restart often resolves sound issues. Turn your device off completely and then turn it back on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
