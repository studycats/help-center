<p>Determining the right amount of time for your child to spend on language learning can be crucial for their development and interest in the new language. With Studycat, a balanced approach is key to making the learning process effective and enjoyable.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Study Time:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Frequency</strong>: Aim for 3-5 times a week. Consistent exposure helps reinforce new vocabulary and concepts without overwhelming your child.</p>
<p>- <strong>Duration</strong>: Each session should last about 15 minutes. This duration is ideal for maintaining your child’s attention and ensuring they stay engaged without feeling fatigued.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility and Progression:</strong></p>
<p>While starting with 15-minute sessions, it's important to remain flexible and adapt to your child’s growing interest and capability. As your child becomes more comfortable and engaged with the language, you can gradually increase the duration of the sessions.</p>
<p>The key is to monitor your child’s enthusiasm and response. If they show a keen interest, extending learning time can be beneficial. Conversely, if they seem fatigued, it’s perfectly fine to stick with shorter sessions.</p>
