<h2>Why does Learn English need microphone access?</h2>
<p>Learn English needs your device's microphone for speaking activities and pronunciation practice. This helps improve your child's speaking skills and pronunciation.</p>
<h2>How to enable microphone access</h2>
<p>If you previously denied microphone access, you'll need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Microphone</strong></li>
<li>Find <strong>Learn English</strong> in the list of apps</li>
<li>Toggle the switch next to Learn English to <strong>ON</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Still having issues?</h2>
<p>If you continue to experience problems with microphone access:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have the latest version of Learn English installed</li>
<li>Try restarting your device</li>
<li>If the problem persists, please contact our support team</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Microphone access is required for many learning activities. Without it, some speaking and pronunciation features will not work properly.</p>
