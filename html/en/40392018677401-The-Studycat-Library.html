<p>The Studycat Library gives your child additional opportunities to learn English through fun songs and stories. Each story follows Studycat and friends on their adventures, helping children practice the words they've learned in the app. Through animated stories and catchy songs, children hear how to use these words naturally, making learning and retaining new vocabulary easier.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can now find all your favorite Studycat songs easily in the library.</p>
