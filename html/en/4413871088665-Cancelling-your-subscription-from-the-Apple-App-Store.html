<p>If you purchased your free trial or subscription from within your Studycat app on an iOS device, your account is managed through your Apple ID.</p>
<p>Apple does not share your personal or purchase details with Studycat. Furthermore, Apple will only accept account instructions from the account holder, which means that we are unable to request this on your behalf. Please follow the instructions below to cancel your subscription.</p>
<h2>How to cancel a subscription on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch</h2>
