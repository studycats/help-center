It’s a fish-eat-fish world out there, and if you’re going to succeed, you need to be bigger and faster than all the other fish in the sea. Let’s learn how to do just that. Welcome to the ***Fish Eater*** game!

**Objective**
-------------

**It’s dangerous in the open water. So, our goal is to ***become the biggest, fastest fish***in the ocean so no other fish can bully us. We do this by eating other fishies that are smaller than us!**

**Controls**
------------

If you’re going to survive, you’ll need to know how to swim. ***With your finger, tap anywhere on the screen*** to swim to that spot. Once you’ve got that down, you’re ready to start eating fish. But we can’t eat just any fish, some are ***bigger and faster*** than us.

**Eating Fish**
---------------

Luckily, we have our trusty friend the ***narrator*** to guide us!

If you listen closely, the narrator will tell you the ***biggest*** fish you can eat.

In this example, we’re told we can eat ***shrimp***. So let’s ***tap the screen*** towards the nearest shrimp.

Got ‘em! Yum!

Let’s keep it up, we’re a very hungry little fish. We need to eat all the ***shrimp*** we can find.

But, we can’t just go swimming anywhere, willy-nilly… There are bigger fish afoot! Or… a-fin?

**Becoming Fish Food**

Uhh.. Yeah. Let’s avoid those guys. We’re not ***big enough*** to eat them yet.

**Growing**

Pick on someone your own size! Look at them trying to get away!

See, once you’ve eaten enough small fries you can move on to bigger game.

Oh, but what’s this? ***Crabs***? Yep, and they’re after you just like those last fish were.

**Gameplay Loop**
-----------------

Next, you’re going to have to get big enough to start eating those crabs, and now you know how to do that. Everything smaller than you is on the menu.

But remember, there are always bigger fish in the sea. No matter how much you grow, you’re going to have to watch out for bigger, faster fish.

**Victory**
-----------

When you eat enough fish, you get bigger, and the ***progress bar*** will go up a level.

All you have to do to win is fill up the progress bar completely.

**Ranks**
---------

All games have three ranks, and the difficulty increases with each one.

| **Rank 1** | You can make as many mistakes as you like. |
| --- | --- |
| **Rank 2** | You have to eat more fish. You will lose if you make too many mistakes. |
| **Rank 3** | You have to eat even more fish. You will lose if you make too many mistakes. |

**Let’s play!**
---------------

Alright, it’s time to take off the floaties and throw you in the deep end.

You know what you’ve got to do. Just keep swimming, just keep swimming!
