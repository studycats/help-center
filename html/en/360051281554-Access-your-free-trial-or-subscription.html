<h2>Purchases from the Apple App Store or Google Play</h2>
<p>To access subscription content from an in-app purchase, restore your purchases in the 'Parents' area. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. Open Studycat and tap 'Parents' from the main menu.</p>
<p>[rest of the content remains unchanged until "IMPORTANT" section]</p>
<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the same Apple ID or Google account used for your original purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Family Sharing</strong>: Apple App Store subscriptions can be shared through <a href="https://www.apple.com/family-sharing/">Apple Family Sharing</a></li>
