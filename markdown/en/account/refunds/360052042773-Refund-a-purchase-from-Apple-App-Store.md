### If you can't request a refund on reportaproblem.apple.com

- If the charge is pending, you canʼt request a refund yet. After the charge goes through, try to request a refund again.

- If you have an unpaid order, you need to pay for that order before you request a refund. You might need to [update your payment information](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201266).

- If you don't know why you were charged, review your family members' purchases. If you're the family organiser, tap the Apple ID button, then choose All. Purchases charged to your shared payment method appear.
