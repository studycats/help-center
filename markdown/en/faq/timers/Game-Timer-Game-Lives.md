Some games within our apps feature limited time or limited lives, which makes them harder to finish.

Younger learners may have trouble completing games because of these limits. If you want to remove these limits:

1. Navigate to ⚙️ Settings  
2. Look for the _Game clocks_ and _Game lives_
3. Toggle them on or off as desired
