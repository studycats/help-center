<p>Welcome to the <strong><em>Fish Eater</em></strong> game! In this ocean-themed adventure, you'll need to be bigger and faster than the other fish to survive. Let's learn how to play!</p>
<h2><strong>Goal</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The open water is full of danger. Your mission is to </strong><em>become the biggest, fastest fish</em><strong> in the ocean by eating smaller fish. That way, no other fish will be able to threaten you!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>How to Play</strong></h2>
<p>To swim around, simply <strong><em>tap anywhere on the screen</em></strong> with your finger. Your fish will swim to that spot. Remember, you can't eat just any fish – some are <strong><em>bigger and faster</em></strong> than you.</p>
<h2><strong>Eating Fish</strong></h2>
<p>Don't worry – our friendly <strong><em>narrator</em></strong> is here to help!</p>
<p>Listen carefully to the narrator, who will tell you which fish you can safely eat.</p>
<p>For example, if the narrator says you can eat <strong><em>shrimp</em></strong>, <strong><em>tap the screen</em></strong> to swim toward the nearest shrimp.</p>

<p>Great catch! Keep going – your fish is hungry! Try to eat all the <strong><em>shrimp</em></strong> you can find.</p>
<p>But be careful where you swim – bigger fish are looking for their next meal too!</p>
<h2><strong>Avoiding Bigger Fish</strong></h2>

<p>Oops! Stay away from those big ones. We're not <strong><em>big enough</em></strong> to eat them yet.</p>
<h2><strong>Growing Bigger</strong></h2>

<p>Now the tables have turned! Watch those smaller fish try to escape!</p>
<p>After eating enough small fish, you can start hunting bigger ones.</p>
<p>Watch out though – those <strong><em>crabs</em></strong> are now after you, just like the bigger fish were before.</p>
<h2><strong>Game Progress</strong></h2>
<p>Next step: grow big enough to eat those crabs. You know what to do – eat anything smaller than you.</p>
<p>Just remember: there's always a bigger fish. No matter how large you get, watch out for bigger, faster fish.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Win</strong></h2>
<p>Eat fish to grow bigger and fill up the <strong><em>progress bar</em></strong> level by level.</p>
<p>To win, simply fill the progress bar completely.</p>
