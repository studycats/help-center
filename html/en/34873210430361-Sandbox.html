<p>Welcome to Sandbox, an innovative game designed to help your child learn a new language while having fun. Let your child dive into the sandbox, uncover hidden words and phrases, and expand their vocabulary in an engaging and interactive way.</p>
<h2>Game Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of Sandbox is simple: uncover all the hidden words in the sandbox. Players swipe away the sand to reveal language treasures underneath. The more they explore, the more new words they discover and learn!</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Playing Sandbox is easy. Your child simply uses their finger to swipe across the sandbox on the screen. This swiping action simulates digging and reveals hidden words and phrases.</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<h3>Digging for Words</h3>
<p>Players dig for words by looking for shadows beneath the sand. These shadows hint at hidden words and phrases waiting to be discovered.</p>

<h3>Uncovering Words</h3>
<p>When a word or phrase is completely cleared of sand, the game presents it in both your native language and the target language. This helps reinforce learning through direct association.</p>
<h3>Finding Special Items</h3>
<p>While digging, players might discover special items that create additional learning opportunities. For example, finding a rubber duck teaches the word "duck" in the target language.</p>
