The new **Progress Panel** makes it easy to track your child's learning journey at a glance. It shows how much your child has completed and what's next. Celebrate their progress as they move through their learning adventure!

Located in the bottom right corner of the app.

Each medal in the panel represents a lesson your child needs to complete, with each lesson containing 3â€“6 fun and engaging games. Learners earn stars after each activity and medals when they complete a lesson. The picture icons represent the topics.
