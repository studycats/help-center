<p>Bob will say phrases like:</p>
<p>| <strong>It's my pen</strong> | Give the pen to Bob, the red cat |
| <strong>It's your pen</strong> | Take the pen for yourself, the purple cat |
| <strong>It's his pen</strong> | Give the pen to Tom, the blue cat |
| <strong>It's her pen</strong> | Give the pen to Ali, the pink cat |</p>
<p>Listen carefully to decide who should receive each item.</p>
<h3>Moving the Object</h3>

<p>Move the object to the correct cat by dragging it up, right, left, or down the screen.</p>
<h2>Progression</h2>
<p>As you advance, Bob will change how he speaks:</p>
<p>| <strong>1</strong> | It's [pronoun] [object] |
| <strong>2</strong> | It's [pronoun] |
| <strong>3</strong> | [pronoun] |</p>
<p>For example:
"It's her pen" -&gt; "It's hers" -&gt; "hers"</p>
<h2>Gameplay Loop</h2>
<p>You'll need to return multiple items at each stage to complete the game.</p>
<h2>Victory</h2>
<p>To win, you must correctly identify all the items and give them to their rightful owners.</p>
