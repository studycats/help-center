If you're having trouble hearing sound in the Studycat app, try these troubleshooting steps:


1. **Check Your Volume:**


    * Make sure your device's volume is turned up. Use the volume buttons on your device to adjust the sound level.
2. **Turn Off Silent Mode:**


    * Check that your device isn't in silent mode. Switch off silent mode using the toggle switch on the side of your device or through the settings menu.
3. **Enable Background Music:**


    * Open the Studycat app and go to the settings menu.
    * Verify that background music is turned on.
4. **Check Other Apps:**


    * Test if the sound issue is specific to the Studycat app by playing audio in other apps (like YouTube or your music player).
    * If there's no sound in other apps, the problem might be with your device rather than the Studycat app.
5. **Restart Your Device:**


    * A simple restart often resolves sound issues. Turn your device off completely and then turn it back on.
