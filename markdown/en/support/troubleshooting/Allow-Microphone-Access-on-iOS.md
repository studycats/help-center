Why does Studycat need microphone access?
-----------------------------------------

Studycat uses your device's microphone for speaking activities and pronunciation practice. This helps improve your child's speaking skills and pronunciation.  
  

How to enable microphone access
-------------------------------

If you previously denied microphone access, you'll need to:  
  

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy & Security** > **Microphone**
2. Find **Studycat** in the list of apps
3. Toggle the switch next to Studycat to **ON**

Still having issues?
--------------------

If you continue to experience problems with microphone access:

* Make sure you have the latest version of Studycat installed
* Try restarting your device
* If the problem persists, please contact our support team

**Note:** Microphone access is essential for many learning activities. Without it, some speaking and pronunciation features may not work properly.
